				<p>Amelia, who lost her husband in a car crash on the way to give birth to Samuel, their only child, struggles to cope with her fate as a single mom. Samuel&#39;s constant fear of monsters and violent reaction to overcome the fear doesn&#39;t help her cause either, which makes her friends become distant. When things can not get any worse, they read a strange book in their house about the &#39;Babadook&#39; monster that hides in the dark areas of their house. Even Amelia seems to feel the effect of Babadook and desperately tries in vain to destroy the book. The nightmarish experiences the two encounter form the rest of the story.</p>

				<p>Baby is a young and partially hearing impaired getaway driver who can make any wild move while in motion with the right track playing. It&#39;s a critical talent he needs to survive his indentured servitude to the crime boss, Doc, who values his role in his meticulously planned robberies.

				<h4 class="modal-title">Children of Men (2006)</h4>
				<p>No children. No future. No hope.</p>
				<p>London, 2027. In this dystopian world, humans have been incapable of reproducing for eighteen years for an unknown reason, meaning the imminent extinction of the species. Britain is the one remaining civilized society on the planet, which has resulted in people wanting to immigrate there. As such, it has become a police state in order to handle the immigrants, who are placed into refugee camps. Lowly government bureaucrat Theo Faron, once an activist, is approached by the Fishes, deemed a terrorist group, led by his ex-wife Julian Taylor, who he has not seen in close to twenty years, their marriage which disintegrated following the death of their infant son Dylan during the 2008 flu pandemic. Although the Fishes did use terrorist means in their on-going revolution against the state in the fight for immigrant rights, Julian vows that they now garner support solely by speaking to the people. What she wants is for Theo to use his connections to get transit papers for a young immigrant woman named Kee who needs to get to the coast. Although initially reluctant to do it because of the difficulty, Theo is able to grant Julian this favor, however with the change that he now needs to accompany Kee on her journey. As Theo and Kee progress on that journey, Theo learns more and more about what&#39;s going on, including the reason that Kee needs to get to the coast, the fact that no one in the group knows if their end destination even exists, and that his and Kee&#39;s lives are in greater danger than he believed when they started the journey. But Theo&#39;s sole mission becomes to help Kee at any cost for the survival of the species.</p>

				<h4 class="modal-title">Gisaengchung (2019)</h4>
				<p>Misplaced familyhood (Australia/New Zealand/Singapore)</p>
				<p>The Kims - mother and father Chung-sook and Ki-taek, and their young adult offspring, son Ki-woo and daughter Ki-jung - are a poor family living in a shabby and cramped half basement apartment in a busy lower working class commercial district of Seoul. Without even knowing it, they, especially Mr. and Mrs. Kim, literally smell of poverty. Often as a collective, they perpetrate minor scams to get by, and even when they have jobs, they do the minimum work required. Ki-woo is the one who has dreams of getting out of poverty by one day going to university. Despite not having that university education, Ki-woo is chosen by his university student friend Min, who is leaving to go to school, to take over his tutoring job to Park Da-hye, who Min plans to date once he returns to Seoul and she herself is in university. The Parks are a wealthy family who for four years have lived in their modernistic house designed by and the former residence of famed architect Namgoong. While Mr. and Mrs. Park are all about status, Mrs. Park has a flighty, simpleminded mentality and temperament, which Min tells Ki-woo to feel comfortable in lying to her about his education to get the job. In getting the job, Ki-woo further learns that Mrs. Park is looking for an art therapist for the Parks&#39; adolescent son, Da-song, Ki-woo quickly recommending his professional art therapist friend &quot;Jessica&quot;, really Ki-jung who he knows can pull off the scam in being the easiest liar of the four Kims. In Ki-woo also falling for Da-hye, he begins to envision himself in that house, and thus the Kims as a collective start a plan for all the Kims, like Ki-jung using assumed names, to replace existing servants in the Parks&#39; employ in orchestrating reasons for them to be fired. The most difficult to get rid of may be Moon-gwang, the Parks&#39; housekeeper who literally came with the house - she Namgoong&#39;s housekeeper when he lived there - and thus knows all the little nooks and crannies of it better than the Parks themselves. The question then becomes how far the Kims can take this scam in their quest to become their version of the Parks.</p>

Often as a collective, they perpetrate minor scams to get by, and even when they have jobs, they do the minimum work required. Ki-woo is the one who has dreams of getting out of poverty by one day going to university. Despite not having that university education, Ki-woo is chosen by his university student friend Min, who is leaving to go to school, to take over his tutoring job to Park Da-hye, who Min plans to date once he returns to Seoul and she herself is in university. The Parks are a wealthy family who for four years have lived in their modernistic house designed by and the former residence of famed architect Namgoong. While Mr. and Mrs. Park are all about status, Mrs. Park has a flighty, simpleminded mentality and temperament, which Min tells Ki-woo to feel comfortable in lying to her about his education to get the job. In getting the job, Ki-woo further learns that Mrs. Park is looking for an art therapist for the Parks&#39; adolescent son, Da-song, Ki-woo quickly recommending his professional art therapist friend &quot;Jessica&quot;, really Ki-jung who he knows can pull off the scam in being the easiest liar of the four Kims. In Ki-woo also falling for Da-hye, he begins to envision himself in that house, and thus the Kims as a collective start a plan for all the Kims, like Ki-jung using assumed names, to replace existing servants in the Parks&#39; employ in orchestrating reasons for them to be fired. The most difficult to get rid of may be Moon-gwang, the Parks&#39; housekeeper who literally came with the house - she Namgoong&#39;s housekeeper when he lived there - and thus knows all the little nooks and crannies of it better than the Parks themselves. The question then becomes how far the Kims can take this scam in their quest to become their version of the Parks.</p>

				<p>Held yearly for centuries, the Ocean of Fire--a 3,000 mile survival race across the Arabian desert--was a challenge restricted to the finest Arabian horses ever bred, the purest and noblest lines, owned by the greatest royal families. In 1890, a wealthy sheik invited an American, Frank T. Hopkins, and his horse to enter the race for the first time. During the course of his career, Hopkins was a cowboy and dispatch rider for the U.S. cavalry--and had once been billed as the greatest rider the West had ever known. The Sheik puts his claim to the test, pitting the American cowboy and his mustang, Hidalgo, against the world&#39;s greatest Arabian horses and Bedouin riders--some of whom are determined to prevent a foreigner from finishing the race. For Frank, the Ocean of Fire becomes not only a matter of pride and honor, but a race for his very survival as he and his horse attempt the impossible.</p>

				<h4 class="modal-title">Il buono, il brutto, il cattivo (1968)</h4>
				<p>They formed an alliance of hate to steal a fortune in dead man&#39;s gold</p>
				<p>Blondie (The Good) (Clint Eastwood) is a professional gunslinger who is out trying to earn a few dollars. Angel Eyes (The Bad) (Lee Van Cleef) is a hitman who always commits to a task and sees it through, as long as he is paid to do so. And Tuco (The Ugly) (Eli Wallach) is a wanted outlaw trying to take care of his own hide. Tuco and Blondie share a partnership together making money off of Tuco&#39;s bounty, but when Blondie unties the partnership, Tuco tries to hunt down Blondie. When Blondie and Tuco come across a horse carriage loaded with dead bodies, they soon learn from the only survivor, Bill Carson (Antonio Casale), that he and a few other men have buried a stash of gold in a cemetery. Unfortunately, Carson dies and Tuco only finds out the name of the cemetery, while Blondie finds out the name on the grave. Now the two must keep each other alive in order to find the gold. Angel Eyes (who had been looking for Bill Carson) discovers that Tuco and Blondie met with Carson and knows they know the location of the gold. All he needs is for the two to lead him to it. Now The Good, the Bad and the Ugly must all battle it out to get their hands on two hundred thousand dollars worth of gold.</p>

To beat the game and return to the real world, they must go on the most dangerous adventure of their lives, discover what Alan Parrish left 20 years ago, and change the way they think about themselves --or they&#39;ll be stuck in the game forever, to be played by others without break.</p>

				<p>When monstrous creatures, known as Kaiju, started rising from the sea, a war began that would take millions of lives and consume humanity&#39;s resources for years on end. To combat the giant Kaiju, a special type of weapon was devised: massive robots, called Jaegers, which are controlled simultaneously by two pilots whose minds are locked in a neural bridge. But even the Jaegers are proving nearly defenseless in the face of the relentless Kaiju. On the verge of defeat, the forces defending mankind have no choice but to turn to two unlikely heroes - a washed up former pilot (Charlie Hunnam) and an untested trainee (Rinko Kikuchi) - who are teamed to drive a legendary but seemingly obsolete Jaeger from the past.

				<p>The husband, the wife...or the bandit?</p>
				<p>A priest, a woodcutter and another man are taking refuge from a rainstorm in the shell of a former gatehouse called Rash&#244;mon. The priest and the woodcutter are recounting the story of a murdered samurai whose body the woodcutter discovered three days earlier in a forest grove. Both were summoned to testify at the murder trial, the priest who ran into the samurai and his wife traveling through the forest just before the murder occurred. Three other people who testified at the trial are supposedly the only direct witnesses: a notorious bandit named Taj&#244;maru, who allegedly murdered the samurai and raped his wife; the white veil cloaked wife of the samurai; and the samurai himself who testifies through the use of a medium. The three tell a similarly structured story - that Taj&#244;maru kidnapped and bound the samurai so that he could rape the wife - but which ultimately contradict each other, the motivations and the actual killing being what differ. The woodcutter reveals at Rash&#244;mon that he knows more than he let on at the trial, thus bringing into question his own actions. But another discovery at Rash&#244;mon and the resulting actions from the discovery bring back into focus the woodcutter&#39;s own humanity or lack thereof.</p>

				<h4 class="modal-title">Slumdog Millionaire (2009)</h4>
				<p>Love and money... You have mixed them both.</p>
				<p>The story of Jamal Malik, an 18 year-old orphan from the slums of Mumbai, who is about to experience the biggest day of his life. With the whole nation watching, he is just one question away from winning a staggering 20 million rupees on India&#39;s Kaun Banega Crorepati? (2000) (Who Wants To Be A Millionaire?) But when the show breaks for the night, police arrest him on suspicion of cheating; how could a street kid know so much? Desperate to prove his innocence, Jamal tells the story of his life in the slum where he and his brother grew up, of their adventures together on the road, of vicious encounters with local gangs, and of Latika, the girl he loved and lost. Each chapter of his story reveals the key to the answer to one of the game show&#39;s questions. Each chapter of Jamal&#39;s increasingly layered story reveals where he learned the answers to the show&#39;s seemingly impossible quizzes. But one question remains a mystery: what is this young man with no apparent desire for riches really doing on the game show? When the new day dawns and Jamal returns to answer the final question, the Inspector and sixty million viewers are about to find out. At the heart of its storytelling lies the question of how anyone comes to know the things they know about life and love.</p>

				<h4 class="modal-title">Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones (2002)</h4>
				<p>A Jedi Shall Not Know Anger.  Nor Hatred.  Nor Love.</p>
				<p>Ten years after the invasion of Naboo, the Galactic Republic is facing a Separatist movement and the former queen and now Senator Padm&#233; Amidala travels to Coruscant to vote on a project to create an army to help the Jedi to protect the Republic. Upon arrival, she escapes from an attempt to kill her, and Obi-Wan Kenobi and his Padawan Anakin Skywalker are assigned to protect her. They chase the shape-shifter Zam Wessell but she is killed by a poisoned dart before revealing who hired her. The Jedi Council assigns Obi-Wan Kenobi to discover who has tried to kill Amidala and Anakin to protect her in Naboo. Obi-Wan discovers that the dart is from the planet Kamino, and he heads to the remote planet. He finds an army of clones that has been under production for years for the Republic and that the bounty hunter Jango Fett was the matrix for the clones. Meanwhile Anakin and Amidala fall in love with each other, and he has nightmarish visions of his mother. They travel to his home planet, Tatooine, to see his mother, and he discovers that she has been abducted by Tusken Raiders. Anakin finds his mother dying, and he kills all the Tusken tribe, including the women and children. Obi-Wan follows Jango Fett to the planet Geonosis where he discovers who is behind the Separatist movement. He transmits his discoveries to Anakin since he cannot reach the Jedi Council. Who is the leader of the Separatist movement? Will Anakin receive Obi-Wan&#39;s message? And will the secret love between Anakin and Amidala succeed?</p>

				<h4 class="modal-title">Thor: The Dark World (2013)</h4>
				<p>There was darkness.</p>
				<p>Thousands of years ago, a race of beings known as Dark Elves tried to send the universe into darkness by using a weapon known as the Aether. Warriors from Asgard stopped them, but their leader Malekith (Christopher Eccleston) escaped to wait for another opportunity. The warriors find the Aether, and since it cannot be destroyed, they try to hide it. In the present day, Jane Foster (Natalie Portman) awaits the return of Thor (Chris Hemsworth), although it has been two years since they last saw once another. In the meantime, Thor has been trying to bring peace to the nine realms. Jane discovers an anomaly similar to the one that brought Thor to Earth. She goes to investigate, finds a wormhole, and is sucked into it. Back on Asgard, Thor wishes to return to Earth, but his father, Odin (Sir Anthony Hopkins), refuses to let him. Thor learns from Heimdall (Idris Elba), who can see into all of the realms, that Jane disappeared. Thor then returns to Earth just as Jane reappears. However, when some Policemen try to arrest her, an unknown energy repulses them. Thor then brings Jane to Asgard to find out what happened to her. When the energy is released again, they discover that when Jane disappeared, she crossed paths with the Aether and it entered her. Malekith, upon sensing that the time to strike is now, seeks out the Aether. He attacks Asgard and Thor&#39;s mother Frigga (Rene Russo) is killed protecting Jane. Odin wants to keep Jane on Asgard so that Malekith will come. Thor disagrees with his plan, so with his cohorts, he decides to take Jane away. He enlists the aid of his brother, Loki (Tom Hiddleston). Unfortunately, Loki&#39;s motivations remain unknown.</p>

While some mutants do like the idea of a &quot;cure&quot;, including Rogue, many mutants find that there shouldn&#39;t be a &quot;cure&quot;. Magneto, who still believes a war is coming, recruits a large team of mutants to take down Warren Worthington II and his &quot;cure&quot;. Might seem easy for the X-Men to stop, but Magneto has a big advantage, which Wolverine doesn&#39;t have. Jean Grey has returned, and joined with Magneto.

While some mutants do like the idea of a &quot;cure&quot;, including Rogue, many mutants find that there shouldn&#39;t be a &quot;cure&quot;. Magneto, who still believes a war is coming, recruits a large team of mutants to take down Warren Worthington II and his &quot;cure&quot;. Might seem easy for the X-Men to stop, but Magneto has a big advantage, which Wolverine doesn&#39;t have. Jean Grey has returned, and joined with Magneto. The Dark Phoenix has woken within her, which has the ability to destroy anything in her way, even if that &quot;anything&quot; is an X-Man.</p>

One day, a mutant by the name of Nightcrawler infiltrates the White House and attempts to assassinate the President, setting off a chain reaction of anti-mutant measures by the government.

Besides the violence he spreads, this time he sings to the crew of the pine tree that are needed for a proper &quot;X-mas&quot;. The only problem is that the pine trees have been extinct for over 800 years. However they manage to get some seeds, reforesting the earth. As the oxygen levels explode Bender causes the whole earth to catch fire. 2. Several weeks later, out of laziness Bender insists on celebrating the fake &quot;Robanaca&quot;. For the traditional oil wrestling he needs petroleum oil but all petroleum resources are empty. The Professor tells him that a small quantity might be left, buried deep inside the earth and the quest begins. The ship crashes and 500 Million years later Bender alone returns to the surface bringing with him petroleum oil that originates from the remains of the others. 3. The unrelated conclusion: Everybody are celebrating &quot;Kwanzaa&quot; at Hermes&#39; home. Kwanzaa-bot breaks through the wall and explains the tradition of Kwanzaa where beeswax plays is needed for the special Kwanzaa-candles. Of course they have run out of it, so they have to fly to the space bees hive to get some. When they arrive they find out the bees are infected and going crazy. Finally the spirit of Kwanzaa kills the parasites and the space bees unite to attack the crew.</div>

Using freeze frames, she introduces herself and explains her nickname, Katie as possibly two-faced, Howie as snarky, Ed as always late, and Denise as her new Besty, but Denise comes off as kind of a bully.

In orientation, Ted tells the interns that lawsuits are bad and that they should never tell a patient if they make a mistake. Dr. Cox enters the orientation and tells the interns that it will not be a fun year for anybody, and when Sunny tells her camera she is still going to enjoy it, he confiscates her camera.

Later, Sunny tells the camera that a Janitor sold her her camera back, and pays The Worthless Peons to perform a theme song for her video diary.</div>

Dr. John Dorian enters the room, apologizes for having to leave, and continues giving a lesson about hospital vernacular. He explains many acronyms such as CTD (circling the drain), T.C.W. (tasty coma wife), &quot;gomer&quot; (get outta my emergency room), turfing and bouncing (send patients to other wards), LGFD (looks good from door) and HFFA (hot from far away).

Ted enters and notifies Janitor that his next appointment - a man with a raccoon - has arrived. Janitor then kicks the interns out of his office.</div>

As it turns out, Jimmy has taken it from her, to film a fake talk show called The Jimmy the Orderly Show. In it, he impersonates the talk show host and several well known actors from TV and cinema.

Then, Sunny comes into the room, where Jimmy is, and sees, that he took her camery. But he says, that he only borrowed it for the Jimmy the Orderly Show. And since every Jimmy the Orderly Show ends in a dance off, Sunny and Jimmy began to dance.</div>

At the meeting, Janitor calls the meeting to order with a hammer as a gavel. He explains that Doug is not present because he may have looked at Janitor wrong. Janitor denies Todd&#39;s motion to date Sunny, and also denies his motion to go shirtless for the rest of the meeting. Ted is upset because it is very hot in the meeting. Janitor states that Sunny&#39;s cameras are not only important because they will capture the Brain Trust so children can later learn from it, but also so she can make Legal Custodians, a sitcom featuring Janitor and Ted as parents. Todd wants to be in the series, but Janitor tells him that they will just CGI in a child later.

They record the theme sequence, but when it comes time to shoot the pilot, Janitor tells Sunny to write the script. Sunny tells the viewers that next week will feature the pilot episode of Legal Custodians.</div>

The Janitor also quizzes Ted as to what &quot;jump the shark&quot; means, and he can&#39;t answer. Ted also explains that he has never had to memorize a closing statement for a court case before. In the end, Ted can&#39;t stand his sweater anymore and ends up pulling it over his face, running into a wall, and falling to the ground.

At the same time, Todd hides behind the couch and the counter holding the &quot;child&quot; in the sitcom.</div>
